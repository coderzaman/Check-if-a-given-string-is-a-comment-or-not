# C++ Comment Detection

This C++ program allows users to input a code snippet and determines whether it contains a single-line comment (`//`), a multi-line comment (`/* */`), or no comments at all. The program uses a stack-based approach to efficiently parse and identify different types of comments within the given input.

## Features

- **Single-Line Comment Detection:** Identifies and reports single-line comments in the code.
- **Multi-Line Comment Detection:** Detects and reports properly closed multi-line comments.
- **User Input:** Enables users to input code snippets for comment detection.

## Usage

1. **Run the program:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Compile and run the program using your preferred C++ compiler.

2. **Input the code snippet:**
   - Follow the prompts to input your code snippet.

3. **Receive Output:**
   - The program will provide a clear output indicating the presence or absence of comments in the provided code.
